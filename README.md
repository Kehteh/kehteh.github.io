## Project Requirements

### Content
 Add a short paragraph describing the features below. What aesthetic and technical choices did you make? 
- [ ] At least one profile picture
- [ ] Biography (at least 100 words)
- [ ] Functional Contact Form
- [ ] "Projects" section
- [ ] Links to external sites, e.g. GitHub and LinkedIn.

I went with an oil slick/vapour wave colour palette. I wanted to explore the cozy game raelm so I added my own pixel art cat "Dumpling" that I would like to explore as a potential mascot for my personal branding. I included my original headshot that I applied to She Codes with, and used border-radius to crop it into a circle for aesthetic purposes. My biography proved to be the most difficult section on the page because it is quite long and having the lines flow in an reader-friendly manner was quite the task! My contact form is now functional and connected to Fromspree, with many friends testing it out to send me messages in their down time. My projects section is within it's own page connected via link to the main index page. It is a work progress as this of course is my first project. I've made space for 3 projects. At the foot of each of my pages I have included a footer with functioning links that open up in separate tabs for instagram, linked in and github.   
​
### Technical
 Add a short paragraph describing the features below. What strategies or design decisions did you work from? 
- [ ] At least 2 web pages.
- [ ] Version controlled with Git
- [ ] Deployed on GitHub pages.
- [ ] Implements responsive design principles.
- [ ] Uses semantic HTML.

My two web pages are my main index or "My profile" and my projects page or "Projects" are connected via a JavaScript menu I added to my website. With every major change I was consistently saving via VS code then git adding, committing, merging then pushing content on to GitHub. My website is currently deployed on GitHub pages. At the end of both of my style sheets I have added media queries that are responsive to most, if not all common screen sizes. I have used semantics to the best of my ability to make sure my HTML is legible and clean

### Bonus (optional)
 Add a short paragraph describing the features below, if you included any. 
- [ ] Different styles for active, hover and focus states.
- [ ] Include JavaScript to add some dynamic elements to your site. (Extra tricky!)
​
### Screenshots
> Please include the following:
> - The different pages and features of your website on mobile, tablet and desktop screen sizes (multiple screenshots per page and screen size).
> - The different features of your site, e.g. if you have hover states, take a screenshot that shows that.  
> 
> You can do this by saving the images in a folder in your repo, and including them in your readme document with the following Markdown code:
